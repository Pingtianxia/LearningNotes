0413:Learning Mavlink protocol
0414:Learning git branching model:http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/#summary
0417:Study the stm32f373 to use svpwm controlling the motor.
	Q:when using bootloader the program runaway because of interruption.
	A:because the bootloader set TIM13 interruption, it must be reset by soft otherwise it is always interrupted.
0418:Learning how to use stm32 TIM to generate PWM pulse.
0420:programming the bldc motor driver which use SVPWM method.
0425:Transplant bootloader from intrinsic style to PX4 style:flash read/write protection, aes
	Q:the intrinsic bootloader has "__attribute__((at(0x40001000)))"asm syntax,that will lead to some error.
	A:because of the difference in Keil and GCC's ASM syntax.you can use GUN ld write the variable to fixed address or you can change the statement to:
	:that cann't store the value to fixed flash
		int *var = (int*)0x40001000;
		*var = 4;  
	or: that cann't store the value to fixed flash, maybe lead to program hardfault.
		#define MMIO16(addr)		(*(volatile uint16_t *)(addr))
		#define VAR 0x40001000
		MMIO16(VAR) = 100;
	or: that cann't store the value to fixed flash
		ld.script
			SECTIONS{
				var = 0x08004000;			
			}			
		main.c
			extern int var = 100;



0426:adding stlink burning tool in the makefile.
	1.it is forbidden to write statement out of program function.
