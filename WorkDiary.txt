0413:Learning Mavlink protocol
0414:Learning git branching model:http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/#summary
0417:Study the stm32f373 to use svpwm controlling the motor.
	Q:when using bootloader the program runaway because of interruption.
	A:because the bootloader set TIM13 interruption, it must be reset by soft otherwise it is always interrupted.
0418:Learning how to use stm32 TIM to generate PWM pulse.
0420:programming the bldc motor driver which use SVPWM method.
0425:Transplant bootloader from intrinsic style to PX4 style:flash read/write protection, aes
	Q:the intrinsic bootloader has "__attribute__((at(0x40001000)))"asm syntax,that will lead to some error.
	A:because of the difference in Keil and GCC's ASM syntax.you can use GUN ld write the variable to fixed address or you can change the statement to:
		int *var = (int*)0x40001000;
		*var = 4;
